#8 bit computer Schematics

There's an amazing book called __But How do it know?__ , and I used that book's instructions to build my very own 8 bit computer!

##Schematics

All schematics designed using [Logisim](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution). You need that program to open schematics.
