#8 bit computer Schematics

There's an amazing book called __But How do it know?__ , and I used that book's instructions to build my very own 8 bit computer!

##Schematics

All schematics designed using [Logisim](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution). You need that program to open schematics. 

##Which software did I use?

All PNGs are designed using [Logicly](http://logic.ly), it's a very very simple software to draw and design logic circuits, and combine them as an integrated circuit. It allows you make more complex ICs using another ICs, and that's how I built a lot of circuits like __Memory Address Register__. 
Also, I used __Logisim__ (Link is available), and that's a very nice for people who use Linux like me!
